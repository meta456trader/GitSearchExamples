## GitSearchExamples
when I create this repository, my main goal was to learn how to search git effectively via many search actions that are required in my development.

But unintentionally, this repo also might be valuable by content, itself.

Anyway, important thing here, is about how to search using various query params that GitHub supports amazingly.

If you're interested in git searching, if you want to share your valuable experience about searching, if you want to refine contents, 
<br>**Please *fork*, add content and send me "*pull request*"**.

"Pull Request" is for me, So If you feel uncomfortable with that word, you can say it "Push Request". Nobody blame you.

so far, my search **options**

- [x] user: Alex
- [x] lang: dockerfile
- [x] content: COPY
- [x] [regexp] content:/.*Filter.java/
- [x] topic:sponsorship OR topic:sponsored OR topic:funded OR topic:/.*sponsor.*/
- [X] is:issue is:open author:AlexPankratov1992
      **caution:** AND is not working here
