# GitSearchExamples
when I create this repository, my main goal was to learn how to search git effectively via many search actions.

But unintentionally, it also might be valuable by content, itself.

Anyway, important thing here, is about how to search using various queries that GitHub supports amazingly.

If you're interested in searching, if you want to share your valuable experience about searching, Please fork, add content and send me "pull request".

"Pull Request" is for me, So If you feel uncomfortable with that word, you can say it "Push Request". Nobody blame you.
