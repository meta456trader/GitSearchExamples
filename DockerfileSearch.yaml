title: HOW to set COPY and REMOVE params for files and directories
copy: 
    Motive: wasted too much time for copy problem in dockerfile, the target was really messy structure, quite different from what I expect obviously
            end up with making client angry.
    Query: lang:dockerfile content: COPY
    Unique: [WORKDIR /app] has no trailing slash, compared to Query.
    Examples:
        - case:  >>>> one file 
          code:  COPY requirements.txt /app/
          attention: 
              important: It's good practice to use absolute path inside container.
              true: /app/ 
              false: 
                  - /app
                  - app/
                  - app
                  
        - case: >>>> mulitiple files at a once
              - code: COPY attention_cae.py  calibration_data.py  main.py  \
                     online_models.py  samplers.py  test.py \ 
                     /app/
                 attention: enumerate files by space, also note that /app/ instead of /app or app/ or app.     and if line is too long, i can break it into multiple lines using backslash
              - code: COPY ./api/pyproject.toml ./api/poetry.lock /tmp/
                attention: can use relative path for source param
                
        - case: >>>> one directory
          code: COPY calibration_data /app/calibration_data/
          attention: 
              - instead of using relative path, always depend on absolute path, with trailing slash, leading slash
              - COPY calibration_date /app/       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ this is incorrect.
          
        - case: >>>> multi stage copy, in other words, copy from previous stage image, not from current outside directory/file
          code: FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14 as static###### \
                ... build \
                ARG DOCKER_IMAGE####=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/e1e498-tools/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.8-latest \
                FROM ${DOCKER_IMAGE####} \
                COPY --from=static###### /opt/app-root/src/build /app/static        


DoSomethingInCertainDirectory:
    Motive:
    Query: lang:dockerfile content: COPY
    Opinion: Executing multiple statement at once may reduce the number of snapshots in docker build, But not sure this is true. No Time to check this.
    Examples:
      - case: >>>> install some package in certain directory of container 
        code:     RUN cd /tmp && \
                  poetry install --no-root --no-dev
