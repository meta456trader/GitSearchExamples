title: HOW to set COPY and REMOVE params for files and directories
copy: 
    motive: wasted too much time for copy problem in dockerfile, the target was really messy structure, quite different from what I expect obviously
            end up with making client angry.
    Query: 
        - lang:dockerfile content: COPY
    Examples:
        - case: one file
          code:  COPY requirements.txt /app/
          attention: 
              important: It's good practice to use absolute path inside container.
              true: /app/ 
              false: 
                  - /app
                  - app/
                  - app
        - case: mulitiple files at a once
              - code: COPY attention_cae.py  calibration_data.py  main.py  \
                     online_models.py  samplers.py  test.py \ 
                     /app/
                 attention: enumerate files by space, also note that /app/ instead of /app or app/ or app.     and if line is too long, i can break it into multiple lines using backslash
              - code: COPY ./api/pyproject.toml ./api/poetry.lock /tmp/
                attention: can use relative path for source param
        - case: one directory
          code: COPY calibration_data /app/calibration_data/
          attention: instead of using relative path, always depend on absolute path, with trailing slash, leading slash
    Unique: WORKDIR /app has no trailing slash.
